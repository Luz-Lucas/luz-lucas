            I'm a driven Software Engineering student from Santa Rita do Sapucaí, Minas Gerais, deeply passionate about front-end development. At CP2 Junior Company, I've worked as a Junior Developer, collaborating with cross-functional teams to build client-facing web applications using React, TypeScript, and modern web standards. My focus is on crafting responsive, performant interfaces that prioritize user experience.

            My technical foundation spans HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and tools like Git, VS Code, and Figma. I'm actively exploring the full-stack landscape with Node.js, Express, REST APIs, and databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL. Beyond code, I thrive in collaborative Agile environments, participating in code reviews and pair programming to elevate team quality. I'm eager to bring my front-end expertise and growth mindset to innovative projects.
